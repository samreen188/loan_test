
# README: Loan Test Analysis Notebook

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook designed for analyzing and testing loan datasets. The notebook includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the application of predictive models to assess loan statuses.

## Features
- **Data Loading**: Reads and processes the loan dataset.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Provides insights into key variables and relationships in the data.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, encoding categorical data, and feature scaling.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Implements machine learning models to predict loan outcomes, with evaluation metrics.

## Structure
The notebook is organized as follows:
1. **Introduction**: Overview of the problem statement and objectives.
2. **Libraries and Setup**: Importing necessary Python libraries.
3. **Data Loading**: Loading the dataset and displaying the structure.
4. **EDA**: Visualizations and summary statistics to understand data distributions.
5. **Preprocessing**: Data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering.
6. **Modeling**: Applying machine learning models and evaluating their performance.
7. **Conclusion**: Summarizing findings and insights.

## Libraries Used
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Usage
